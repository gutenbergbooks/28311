<h3>NOTE UPON A PASSAGE IN "MEASURE FOR
MEASURE."</h3>

  <p>The Third Act of <i>Measure for Measure</i> opens with Isabella's
  visit to her brother (Claudio) in the dungeon, where he lies under
  sentence of death. In accordance with Claudio's earnest entreaty, she has
  sued for mercy to Angelo, the sanctimonious deputy, and in the course of
  her allusion to the only terms upon which Angelo is willing to remit the
  sentence, she informs him that he "must die," and then continues:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"This outward-sainted deputy,&mdash;</p>
      <p>Whose settled visage and deliberate word</p>
      <p>Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew,</p>
      <p>As falcon doth the fowl,&mdash;is yet a devil;</p>
      <p>His filth within being cast, he would appear</p>
      <p>A pond as deep as hell."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Whereupon (according to the reading of the folio of 1623) Claudio, who
  is aware of Angelo's reputation for sanctity, exclaims in
  astonishment:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"The <i>prenzie</i> Angelo?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>To which Isabella replies (according to the reading of the same
  edition):</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,</p>
      <p>The damned'st body to invest and cover</p>
      <p>In <i>prenzie</i> guards! Dost thou think, Claudio,</p>
      <p>If I would yield him my virginity,</p>
      <p>Thou might'st be freed?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Claudio, still incredulous, rejoins:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"O, heavens! it cannot be."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word <i>prenzie</i> has given rise to much annotation, and it
  seems to be universally agreed that the word is a misprint. The question
  is, what was the word actually written, or intended, by Shakspeare?
  Steevens and Malone suggested "princely;" Warburton, "priestly;" and
  Tieck, "precise." Mr. Knight adopts "precise," the reading of Tieck, and
  thinks "that, having to choose some word which would have the double
  merit of agreeing with the sense of the passage and be similar in the
  number and form of the letters, nothing can be more unfortunate than the
  correction of "princely;" Mr. Collier, on the other hand, follows
  Steevens and Malone, and reads "princely," observing the Tieck's reading
  ("precise") "sounds ill as regards the metre, the accent falling on the
  wrong syllable. Mr. Collier's choice is determined by the
  <i>authority</i> of the second folio, which he considers ought to have
  considerable weight, whilst Mr. Knight regards the authority of that
  edition as very trifling; and the only point of agreement between the two
  distinguished recent editors is with respect to Warburton's word
  "priestly," which they both seem to think nearly conveys the meaning of
  the poet.</p>

  <p>I have over and over again considered the several emendations which
  have been suggested, and it seems to me that none of them answer all the
  necessary conditions; namely, that the word adopted shall be (1.)
  suitable to the reputed character of Angelo; (2.) an appropriate epithet
  to the word "guards," in the reply of Isabella above quoted; (3.) of the
  proper metre in both <!-- Page 402 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page402"></a>{402}</span>places in which the misprint occurred; and
  (4.) similar in appearance to the word "prenzie." "Princely" does not
  agree with the sense or spirit of the particular passage; for it is
  extremely improbable that Claudio, when confined under sentence of death
  for an absurd and insufficient cause, would use a term of mere compliment
  to the man by whom he had been doomed. "Precise" and "priestly" are both
  far better than "princely;" but "precise" is wholly unsuited to the metre
  in both places, and "priestly" points too much to a special character to
  be appropriate to Angelo's office and position. It may also be remarked,
  that both "princely" and "priestly" differ from the number and form of
  the letters contained in "prenzie."</p>

  <p>The word which I venture to suggest is "<span
  class="sc">Pensive</span>," a word particularly applicable to a person of
  saintly habits, and which is so applied by Milton in "Il Penseroso:"</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Come, pensive nun, devout and pure,</p>
      <p>Sober, stedfast, and demure."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The word "pensive" is stated by Dr. Johnson to mean "sorrowfully
  thoughtful, sorrowfully serious," or melancholy; and that such epithets
  are appropriate to the reputed character of Angelo will be seen from the
  following extracts:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I implore her, in my service, that she make friends</p>
      <p>To the strict deputy."&mdash;<i>Claudio</i>, Act I. Sc. 3.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,</p>
      <p>A man of stricture, and firm abstinence."&mdash;<i>Duke</i>, Act I. Sc. 4.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"Lord Angelo is precise;</p>
      <p>Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses</p>
      <p>That his blood flows, or that his appetite</p>
      <p>Is more to bread than stone."&mdash;<i>Duke</i>, Act I. Sc. 4.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"A man, whose blood</p>
      <p>Is very snow-broth; one who never feels</p>
      <p>The wanton stings and motions of the sense,</p>
      <p>But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge</p>
      <p>With profits of the mind, study and fast."&mdash;<i>Lucio</i>, Act I. Sc. 5.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>See also Angelo's portraiture of himself in the soliloquy at the
  commencement of Act II. Sc. 4.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"My gravity,</p>
      <p>Wherein (let no man hear me) I take pride,</p>
      <p>Could I, with boot, change for an idle plume</p>
      <p>Which the air beats for vain."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>And, lastly, the passage immediately under consideration:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i8hg3">"This outward-sainted deputy,</p>
      <p>Whose settled visage and deliberate word,</p>
      <p>Nips youth i' the head, and follies doth emmew."&mdash;<i>Isabella</i>, Act III. Sc. 1.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Thus much as to the propriety of the word "pensive," in relation to
  the reputed character of Angelo.</p>

  <p>The next question is, whether the word "pensive" is an appropriate
  epithet to the word "guards." If Messrs. Knight and Collier are correct
  in construing "guards" to mean the "trimmings or border of robe," this
  question must be answered in the negative. But it appears to me that they
  are in error, and that the true meaning of the word "guards," in this
  particular passage, is "outward appearances," as suggested by Monck
  Mason; and, consequently, that the expression "pensive guards" means a
  grave or sanctified countenance or demeanour&mdash;"the settled visage
  and deliberate word" which "nips youth i' the head, and follies doth
  emmew."</p>

  <p>It requires no argument to establish that the word "pensive" is
  suitable to the metre in both places in which the misprint occurred and
  it is equally clear that "prenzie" and "pensive" in manuscript are so
  similar, both in the number, form, and character of the letters, that the
  one might easily be printed for the other. The two words also have a
  certain resemblance, in point of sound; and if the word "pensive" be not
  very distinctly pronounced, the mistake might be made by a scribe writing
  from dictation.</p>

  <p>Referring to Mrs. Cowden Clarke's admirable concordance of Shakspeare,
  it appears that the word "pensive" is used by Shakspeare in the
  <i>text</i> of his plays twice; namely, in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Act
  IV. Sc. 1., where Friar Laurence addresses Juliet thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>and again, in the Third Part of <i>Henry VI</i>., Act IV. Sc. 1.,
  where Clarence is thus addressed by King Edward upon the subject of his
  marriage with the Lady Grey:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Now, brother Clarence, how like you our choice,</p>
      <p>That you stand pensive, as half mal-content?"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>I also find that, according to the stage directions (both ancient and
  modern) of Act II. Sc 2. of <i>Henry VIII</i>. (see Collier's
  <i>Shakspeare</i>, vol. v. p. 534., <i>note</i>), the king is described
  to be found "reading pensively," at a moment when he is meditating his
  divorce from Katharine of Arragon, not "because the marriage of his
  brother's wife had crept too near his conscience," but "because his
  conscience had crept too near another lady."</p>

  <p>I might extend the argument by further observations upon the reference
  last cited, but not without risk of losing all chance of a place in
  "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>."</p>

  <p>Query, Whether pen<i>s</i>ive was ever written or printed
  pen<i>z</i>ive in Shakspeare's time? If so, that word would bear a still
  closer resemblance to "prenzie."</p>

<h3>RHYMING LATIN VERSION OF THE SONG ON ROBIN
GOODFELLOW.</h3>

  <p>In the same MS. from which I extracted Braithwait's Latin Drinking
  Song, the following version <!-- Page 403 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page403"></a>{403}</span>of the well-known song on Robin Goodfellow
  occurs. It is apparently by the same hand. I give the English, as it
  contains but six stanzas, and affords some variations from the copy
  printed by Percy; and indeed one stanza not given by him. Peck attributes
  the song to Ben Jonson, but we know not on what foundation. It must be
  confessed that internal evidence is against it. The publication of
  Percy's <i>Reliques</i> had a no less beneficial influence on the
  literature of Germany than it had on our own; and Voss had given an
  admirable version of nine stanzas of this song as early as the year 1793.
  The first stanza will afford some notion of his manner:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="i1hg3">"Von Oberon in Feenland,</p>
      <p class="i1">Dem Könige der Geister,</p>
      <p>Komm' ich, Knecht Robert, abgesandt,</p>
      <p class="i1">Von meinem Herrn und Meister.</p>
      <p class="i2">Als Kobolt und Pux,</p>
      <p class="i2">Wohlkundig des Spuks,</p>
      <p class="i1">Durchschwarm' ich Nacht vor Nacht.</p>
      <p class="i2">Jezt misch' ich mich ein</p>
      <p class="i2">Zum polternden Reihn,</p>
      <p class="i1">Wohlauf, ihr alle, gelacht, gelacht!"</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Although the classic ear may be offended by the "barbarous adjunct of
  rhyme," and by the solecisms and false quantities which sometimes occur,
  "et alia multa damna atque outragia," others may be amused with these
  emulations of the cloistered muse of the Middle Ages. The witty author of
  <i>Whistlecraft</i> has shown that he had a true relish for them, and has
  successfully tried his hand, observing at the same time:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Those monks were poor proficients in divinity,</p>
      <p class="i1">And scarce knew more of Latin than myself;</p>
      <p>Compar'd with theirs, they say that true Latinity</p>
      <p class="i1">Appears like porcelain compar'd with delf."</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>Honest Barnaby had no intention of rivalling Horace: his humbler, but
  not less amusing, prototypes were Walter de Mapes and his cotemporaries.
  We may accept his own defence, if any is needed:</p>

  <div class="poem">

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">DEVONSHIRE FOLK LORE.</p>

  <p>1. <i>Storms from Conjuring</i>.&mdash;A common Devonshire remark on
  the rising of a storm is, "Ah! there is a conjuring going on somewhere."
  The following illustration was told me by an old inhabitant of this
  parish. In the parish of St. Mary Tavy is a spot called "Steven's grave,"
  from a suicide said to have been buried there. His spirit proving
  troublesome to the neighbourhood, was laid by a former curate on Sunday
  after afternoon service. A man who accompanied the clergyman on the way
  was told by him to make haste home, as a storm was coming. The man
  hurried away home; but though the afternoon had previously been very
  fine, he had scarcely reached his door before a violent thunderstorm came
  to verify the clergyman's words.</p>

  <p>2. <i>The Heath-hounds</i>.&mdash;The <i>brutende heer</i> are
  sometimes heard near Dartmoor, and are known by the appellation of
  "Heath-hounds." They were heard in the parish of St. Mary Tavy several
  years ago by an old man called Roger Burn: he was working in the fields,
  when he suddenly heard the baying of the hounds, the shouts and horn of
  the huntsman, and the smacking of his whip. This last point the old man
  quoted as at once settling the question. "How could I be mistaken? why I
  heard the very smacking of his whip."</p>

  <p>3. <i>Cock scares the Fiend</i>.&mdash;Mr. N. was a Devonshire squire
  who had been so unfortunate as to sell his soul to the devil, with the
  condition that after his funeral the fiend should take possession of his
  skin. He had also persuaded a neighbour to undertake to be present on the
  occasion of the flaying. On the death of Mr. N., this man went in a state
  of great alarm to the parson of the parish, and asked his advice. By him
  he was told to fulfil his engagement, but he must be sure and carry a
  cock into the church with him. On the night after the funeral, the man
  proceeded to the church armed with the cock; and, as an additional
  security, took up his position in the parson's pew. At twelve o'clock the
  devil arrived, opened the grave, took the corpse from the coffin and
  flayed it. When the operation was concluded, he held the skin up before
  him, and remarked: "Well! 'twas not worth coming for after all, for it is
  all full of holes!" As he said this, the cock crew; whereupon the fiend,
  turning round to the man, exclaimed: "If it had not been for the bird you
  have got there under your arm, I would have your skin too." But, thanks
  to the cock, the man got home safe again.</p>

  <p>4. <i>Cranmere Pool</i>.&mdash;Cranmere Pool, in the centre of
  Dartmoor, is a great penal settlement for refractory spirits. Many of the
  former inhabitants of this parish are still there expiating their ghostly
  pranks. An old farmer was so troublesome to his survivors as to require
  seven clergymen to secure him. By their means, however, he was
  transformed into a colt; and a servant boy was directed to take him to
  Cranmere Pool. On arriving at the brink of the pool, he was to take off
  the halter, and return instantly without looking round. Curiosity proving
  too powerful, he turned his head to see what was going on, when he beheld
  the colt plunge into the lake in the form of a ball of fire. Before doing
  so, however, he gave the lad a parting salute in the form of a kick,
  which knocked out one of his eyes.</p>

  <p><i>St. Uncumber and the offering of Oats</i> (Vol. ii., pp. 286. 342.
  381.).&mdash;A further illustration of this custom is found in the legend
  of St. Rhadegund, or at least in the metrical version of it, which is
  commonly ascribed to Henry Bradshaw. A copy of this very scarce poem,
  from the press of Pynson, is preserved in the library of Jesus College,
  Cambridge. We there read as follows:</p>

      <p class="i1">Dayly haue be done by grace day and nyght.</p>

    </div>
  </div>

  <p>It is also remarkable that a <i>reason</i> exists in the story of this
  saint for the choice of so strange an offering. As she was escaping from
  her husband, a crop of <i>oats</i> sprang up miraculously, to testify in
  her behalf, and to silence the messengers who had been sent to turn her
  from her purpose.</p>

  <p>On this account is there not room for the conjecture that <i>St.
  Rhadegund</i> is the original St. Uncumber, and that the custom of
  offering oats at Poules, when a wife was weary of her husband, is
  traceable to the story of the French queen, who died in 587.</p>

  <p>"<i>Similia similibus curantur</i>."&mdash;The list proposed by <span

  remedies," based on the above principle, would, I imagine, be of endless
  length; but the following extract from the <i>Herbal</i> of Sir John
  Hill, M.D., "Fellow of the Royal Academy of Sciences at Bordeaux,"
  published in 1789, will show at how late a period such notions have been
  entertained by men of education and even scientific
  attainment:&mdash;</p>

  <p><i>Cure of large Neck</i>.&mdash;I send you two remedies in use here
  for the cure of a common complaint, called "large neck." Perhaps they may
  be worthy of a place in your "Folk Lore."</p>

  <p>A common snake, held by its head and tail, is slowly drawn, by some
  one standing by, nine times across the front part of the neck of the
  person affected, the reptile being allowed, after every third time, to
  crawl about for a while. Afterwards the snake is put alive into a bottle,
  which is corked tightly and then buried in the ground. The tradition is,
  that as the snake decays the swelling vanishes.</p>

  <p>The second mode of treatment is just the same as the above, with the
  exception of the snake's doom. In this case it is killed, and its skin,
  sewn in a piece of silk, is worn round the diseased neck. By degrees the
  swelling in this case also disappears.</p>

<h3>DIBDIN'S LIBRARY COMPANION.</h3>

  <p>A few days since the writer was musing over the treasures of one of
  the most amiable of the bibliographical brotherhood, when his eye rested
  on a document endorsed with the following mysterious notification: "A

  the name of Guido Fawkes have we here! Thinking that the explosion in
  "<span class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" would do no harm, but perhaps

<h2>Minor Notes.</h2>

  <p><i>A Note on Dress.</i>&mdash;Dress is mutable, who denies it? but
  still old fashions are retained to a far greater extent than one would at
  first imagine. The Thames watermen rejoice in the dress of Elizabeth:
  while the royal beefeaters (buffetiers) wear that of private soldiers of
  the time of Henry VII.; the blue-coat boy, the costume of a London
  citizen of the reign of Edward VI.; the London charity-school girls, the
  plain mob cap and long gloves of the time of Queen Anne. In the brass
  badge of the cabmen, we see a retention of the dress of Elizabethan
  retainers: while the shoulder-knots that once decked an officer now adorn
  a footman. The attire of the sailor of William III.'s era is now seen
  amongst our fishermen. The university dress is as old as the age of the
  Smithfield martyrs. The linen bands of the pulpit and the bar are
  abridgments of the falling collar.</p>

  <p>Other costumes are found lurking in provinces, and amongst some
  trades. The butchers' blue is the uniform of a guild. The quaint little
  head-dress of the market women of Kingswood, Gloucestershire, is in fact
  the gipsy hat of George II. Scarlet has been the colour of soldiers'
  uniform from the time of the Lacedemonians. The blue of the army we
  derived from the Puritans; of the navy from the colours of a mistress of
  George I.</p>

  <p><i>Curious Omen at Marriage</i>.&mdash;In Miss Benger's <i>Memoirs of

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is by several writers observed that, towards the close of the
  ceremony, <i>certain coruscations of joy</i> appeared in Elizabeth's
  face, which were afterwards supposed to be sinister presages of her
  misfortunes."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>In a note, Echard is alluded to as the authority for this singular
  circumstance.</p>

  <p>Can any of your readers explain <i>why</i> such a <i>coruscation of
  joy</i> upon a wedding day should forebode evil? or whether any other
  instances are on record of its so doing?</p>

  <p>"I have a letter by me, saith Mr. Clark, dated July 7, 1606, written
  by one Mr. Bovy to a minister in London, where he thus writes: 'Touching
  news, you shall understand that Mr. Sherwood hath received a letter from
  Mr. Arthur Hildersham, which containeth this following narrative: that at
  Brampton, in the parish of Torksey, near Gainsborough in Lincolnshire, an
  ash-tree shaketh both in the body and boughs thereof, and there proceed
  from thence sighs and groans, like those of a man troubled in his sleep,
  as if it felt some sensible torment. Many have climbed to the top
  thereof, where they heard the groans more plainly than they could below.
  One among the rest being a-top, spoke to the tree; but presently came
  down much astonished, and lay grovelling on the earth speechless for
  three hours, and then reviving said, <i>Brampton, Brampton,</i> thou art
  much bound to pray.' The author of this news is one Mr. Vaughan, a
  minister who was there present and heard and saw these passages, and told
  Mr. Hildersham of it. The Earl of Lincoln caused one of the arms of the
  ash to be lopped off, and a hole to be bored into the body, and then was
  the sound or hollow voice heard more audibly than before; but in a kind
  of speech which they could not comprehend nor understand."</p>

  <p><i>Barker, the original Panorama Painter.</i>&mdash;Mr. Cunningham, at
  p. 376. of his admirable <i>Handbook of London,</i> says that Robert
  Barker, who originated the Panorama in Leicester Square, died in 1806.
  Now, Barker, who preceded Burford, and eventually, I think, entered into
  partnership with him, married a friend of my family, a daughter of the
  Admiral Bligh against whom had been the mutiny in the <i>Bounty</i>. I
  remember Mr. Barker, and his house in Surrey Square, or some small square
  on the Surrey side of London Bridge; also its wooden rotunda for painting
  in; and this, too, at the time when the picture of Spitzbergen was in
  progress <!-- Page 407 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page407"></a>{407}</span>and you felt almost a chill as the
  transparent icebergs were splashed on.</p>

  <p>If there have not been two Messrs. Barker connected with the Panorama,
  Mr. Cunningham must be incorrect in his date, for I was not in existence
  in 1806.</p>

  "catche coppe," or "catch-corpe-bell," is not of unfrequent occurrence:
  <i>e.&nbsp;g.</i>, in the account for St. Mary's for the year 1490, we
  have:</p>

  <p><i>Double Names.</i>&mdash;Perhaps some one would explain why so many
  persons formerly bore two names, as "Hooker <i>alias</i> Vowel."
  Illegitimacy may have sometimes caused it: but this will not explain

  <p><i>Legend represented in Frettenham Church.</i>&mdash;Perhaps some one
  of your numerous readers may <!-- Page 408 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page408"></a>{408}</span>be able to give an explanation of the
  following legend, for such I suppose it to be:&mdash;</p>

  <p>In the parish church of Frettenham, co. Norfolk, several alabaster
  carvings were discovered some years ago, near the chancel arch, having
  traces of colour. The most perfect, and the one which had most claims to
  merit as a piece of sculpture, represented a very curious scene. A horse
  was standing fixed in a kind of stocks, a machine for holding animals
  fast while they were being shod. But it (the horse) had only three legs:
  close by stood a Bishop, or mitred Abbot, holding the horse's missing
  fore quarter, on the hoof of which a smith was nailing a shoe. Of course
  the power which had so easily removed a leg would as easily replace
  it.</p>

  <p>The details of the story may be very safely conjectured to have
  been&mdash;a Bishop or high church dignitary is going on a journey or
  pilgrimage; his horse drops a shoe; on being taken to a smith's to have
  it replaced, the animal becomes restive, and cannot be shod even with the
  help of the stocks; whereupon the bishop facilitates the operation in the
  manner before described. One feels tempted to ask why he could not have
  replaced the shoe without the smith's intervention.</p>

  <p>What I want to know is, of whom is this story told? I regret that not
  having seen the carving in question, I can give no particulars of dress,
  &amp;c., which might help to determine its age; nor could my informant,
  though he perfectly well remembered the subject represented. He told me
  that he had often mentioned it to people likely to know of the existence
  of such a legend, but could never gain any information respecting it.</p>

  <p><i>King of Nineveh burns himself in his Palace</i>.&mdash;In a review

  I find the following statement:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The act of Sardanapalus in making his palace his own funeral pyre and
  burning himself upon it, is also attributed to the king who was
  overthrown by Cyaxares."</p>

  <p><i>Butchers not Jurymen</i>.&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"As the law does think it fit</p>
      <p>No butchers shall on juries sit."&mdash;Butler's <i>Ghost</i>, cant. ii.</p>
    </div>
  </div>

  <p>The vulgar error expressed in these lines is not extinct, even at the
  present day. The only explanation I have seen of its origin is given in
  Barrington's <i>Observations on the more Ancient Statutes</i>, p. 474.,
  on 3 Hen. VIII., where, after referring in the text to a statute by which
  surgeons were exempted from attendance on juries, he adds in a note:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It may perhaps be thought singular to suppose that this exemption
  from serving on juries is the foundation of the vulgar error, that a
  surgeon or butcher from the barbarity of their business may be challenged
  as jurors."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Sir H. Spelman, in his <i>Answer to an Apology for Archbishop
  Abbott</i>, says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"In our law, those that were exercised in slaughter of beasts, were
  not received to be triers of the life of a man."&mdash;<i>Posth.
  Works</i>, p. 112.; <i>St. Trials</i>, vol. ii. p. 1171.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>So learned a man as Spelman must, I think, have had some ground for
  this statement, and could scarcely be repeating a vulgar error taking its
  rise from a statute then hardly more than a hundred years old. I hope
  some of your readers will be able to give a more satisfactory explanation
  than Barrington's.</p>

  <p><i>Redwing's Nest</i>.&mdash;I trust you will excuse my asking, if any

  four blackbirds' eggs. The egg answers exactly the description given of
  that of the redwing thrush, both in Bewick and Wood's <i>British Song
  Birds;</i> being bluish-green, with a few largish spots of a dark brown
  colour. The nest was not lined with mud, as is usually the case with a

By W. M.'</p>

  <p>This manuscript is professedly a copy from a publication issued June
  3rd, 1768, by Staples Steare, 93. Fleet Street, price three-pence. It is
  a letter addressed to Lord Mansfield, and an appeal in favour of Wilkes,
  on whom, the writer says, judgment is this day to be pronounced. It is
  written somewhat in the style of Junius. The satire is so refined that
  the reader does not at first suspect that it is satire,&mdash;as in
  Junius's <i>Letters</i>, wherein the satirical compliments to the King
  have been mistaken for praise, and quoted in proof of inconsistency.</p>

  <p>"Who was this 'W. M.'? Who were the writers in the <i>North
  Briton?</i>&mdash;not only 'The Extraordinary' <i>North Briton</i>,
  published by Steare, but the genuine <i>North Briton</i>, published by
  Bingley. These questions may perhaps be very simple, and easily answered
  by persons better informed than ourselves."</p>

  yet been replied to, and this subject is one of great importance, will
  you allow me to recall attention to them?</p>

<h3>VILLENAGE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 327.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent H. C. wishes to know whether bondage was a reality
  in the time of Philip and Mary; and, if so, when it became extinct. It
  was a reality much later than that, as several cases in the books will
  show. Dyer, who was appointed chief justice of the Court of Common Pleas
  in 1559, settled several in which man claimed property in his fellow-man,
  hearing arguments and giving judgment on the point whether one should be
  a "villein regardant" or a "villein in gross." Lord Campbell, in his
  <i>Lives of the Chief Justices</i>, gives the following, tried before
  Dyer, <i>C.J.</i>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A. B., seised in fee of a manor to which a villein was regardant,
  made a feoffment of one acre of the manor by these words: 'I have given
  one acre, &amp;c., and further I have given and granted, &amp;c., John
  S., my villein.' Question, 'Does the villein pass to the grantee as a
  villein in gross, or as a villein appendant to that acre?' The Court
  being equally divided in opinion, no judgment seems to have been
  given."&mdash;<i>Dyer</i>, 48 b. pl. 2.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Another action was brought before him under these
  circumstances:&mdash;Butler, Lord of the Manor of Badminton, in the
  county of Gloucester, contending that Crouch was his villein regardant,
  entered into certain lands, which Crouch had purchased in Somersetshire,
  and leased them to Fleyer. Crouch thereupon disseised Fleyer, who brought
  his action against Crouch, pleading that Butler and his ancestors were
  seised of Crouch and his ancestors as of villeins regardant, from time
  whereof the memory of man runneth not to the contrary. The jury found
  that Butler and his ancestors were seised of Crouch and his ancestors
  until the first year of the reign of Henry VII.; but, confessing
  themselves ignorant whether in point of law such seisin be an actual
  seisin of the defendant, prayed the opinion of the Court thereon. Dyer,
  <i>C.J.</i>, and the other judges agreed upon this to a verdict for the
  defendant, for "the lord having let an hundred years pass without
  redeeming the villein or his issue, cannot, after that, claim them."
  (<i>Dyer</i>, 266. pl. 11.)</p>

  <p>When Holt was chief justice of the King's Bench, an action was tried
  before him to recover the price of a slave who had been sold in Virginia.
  The verdict went for the plaintiff. In deciding upon a motion made in
  arrest of judgment, Holt, <i>C.J.</i>, said,&mdash;"As soon as a negro
  comes into England he is free: one may be a villein in England, but not a
  slave." (<i>Cases temp. Holt</i>, 405.)</p>

  <p>As to the period at which villenage in England became extinct, we find
  in <i>Litt</i>. (sec. 185.):&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Villenage is supposed to have finally disappeared in the reign of
  James I., but there is great difficulty in saying when it ceased to be
  lawful, for there has been no statute to abolish it; and by the old law,
  if any freeman acknowledged himself in a court of record to be a villein,
  he and all his after-born issue and their descendants were villeins."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Even so late as the middle of the eighteenth century, when the great
  Lord Mansfield adorned <!-- Page 411 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page411"></a>{411}</span>the bench, it was pleaded "that villenage,
  or slavery, had been permitted in England by the common law; that no
  statute had ever passed to abolish this <i>status</i>;" and that
  "although <i>de facto</i> villenage by birth had ceased, a man might
  still make himself a villein by acknowledgment in a court of record."
  This was in the celebrated case of the negro Somersett, in which Lord
  Mansfield first established that "the air of England had long been too
  pure for a slave." In his judgment he says,&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"... Then what ground is there for saying that the <i>status</i> of
  slavery is now recognised by the law of England?... At any rate,
  villenage has ceased in England, and it cannot be revived."&mdash;<i>St.
  Tr.</i>, vol. xx. pp. 1-82.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And Macaulay, in his admirable <i>History of England</i>, speaking of
  the gradual and silent extinction of villenage, then, towards the close
  of the Tudor period, fast approaching completion, says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Some faint traces of the institution of villenage were detected by
  the curious as late as the days of the Stuarts; nor has that institution
  ever to this hour been abolished by statute."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">Tee Bee</span>.</p>

  <p><i>Villenage</i> (Vol. iii., p. 327.).&mdash;In reply to the question
  put by H. C., I beg to say that in Burton's <i>Leicestershire</i>
  (published in 1622), a copy of which is now before me, some curious
  remarks occur on this subject. Burton says, under the head of
  "Houghton-on-the-Hill," that the last case he could find in print,
  concerning the claim to a villein, was in Mich. 9 &amp; 10 Eliz.
  (<i>Dyer</i>, 266. b.), where one Butler, Lord of the Manor of Badminton
  in Gloucestershire, did claim one Crouch for his villein regardant to his
  said manor, and made an entry upon Crouch's lands in Somersetshire. Upon
  an answer made by Crouch, an <i>ejectione firmæ</i> was brought in the
  King's Bench; and upon the evidence it was moved, that as no seizure of
  the body had been made, or claim set up by the lord, for sixty years
  preceding, none could then be made. The Court held, in accordance with
  this, that no seizure could be made. I do not know what the reference
  means; perhaps some of your legal correspondents may do so.</p>

<h3>MACLEAN NOT JUNIUS.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. iii., p. 378.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> (<i>antè</i>, p.
  378.) is not justified in writing so confidently on a subject respecting
  which he is so little informed. He is evidently not even aware that the
  claims of Maclean have been ably and elaborately set forth by Sir David
  Brewster, and, as I think, conclusively, on the evidence, set aside in
  the <i>Athenæum</i>. He has, however, been pleased to new vamp some old
  stories, to which he gives something of novelty by telling them "with a
  difference." I remember, indeed, four or five years since, to have seen a
  letter on this subject, written by Mr. Pickering, the bookseller, to the
  late Sir Harris Nicolas, in which the same statements were made,
  supported by the same authorities,&mdash;which, in fact, corresponded so
  exactly with the communication of <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span>, that I
  must believe either that your correspondent has seen that letter, or that
  both writers had their information from a common story-teller.</p>

  <p>Respecting the "vellum-bound copy" locked up in the ebony cabinet in
  possession of the late Marquis of Lansdowne, Mr. Pickering's version came
  nearer to the authority; for he said, "<i>My informant saw</i> the bound
  volumes and the cabinet <i>when a boy</i>." The proof then rests on the
  recollection of an Anonymous, who speaks positively as to what took place
  nearly half a century since; and this anonymous boy, we are to believe,
  was already so interested about Junius as to notice the fact at the time,
  and remember it ever after. Against the probabilities of this we might
  urge, that the present Marquis&mdash;who was born in 1780, and came to
  the title in 1809, is probably as old, or older than Anonymous; as much
  interested in a question believed by many persons, <span
  class="sc">Ægrotus</span> amongst them, intimately to concern his father,
  and quite as precocious, for he was Chancellor of the Exchequer in
  1805&mdash;never saw or heard of either the volumes or the cabinet; and,
  as <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> admits, after a search expressly made
  by his order, they could not be found. Further, allow me to remind you,
  that it is not more than six weeks since it was recorded in "<span
  class="sc">Notes and Queries</span>" that a "vellum-bound" Junius was
  lately sold at Stowe; and it is about two months since I learnt, on the
  same authority, that a Mr. Cramp had asserted that vellum-bound copies
  were so common, that the printer must have taken the Junius copy as a
  pattern; so that, if <span class="sc">Ægrotus's</span> facts be admitted,
  they would prove nothing. There is one circumstance, however, bearing on
  this question, which perhaps <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> himself will
  think entitled to some weight. It was not until 1812, when George
  Woodfall published the private letters of Junius, that the public first
  heard about "a vellum-bound" copy. If therefore the Anonymous knew before
  1809 that some special interest did or would attach more to one
  vellum-bound book than another, he must be Junius himself; for Sampson
  Woodfall was dead, and when living had said nothing about it.</p>

  <p><span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> then favours us with the anecdote
  about "old Mr. Cox" the printer, and that Maclean corrected the proofs of
  <i>Junius' Letters</i> at his printing-office. Of course, persons
  acquainted with the subject have heard the story before, though not with
  all the circumstantialities now given. Where, I might ask, is the
  authority for <!-- Page 412 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page412"></a>{412}</span>this story? Who is responsible for it? But
  the emphatic question which common sense will ask is this: Why should
  Junius go to Mr. Cox's printing-office to correct his proofs? Where he
  wrote the letters he might surely have corrected the proofs. Why, after
  all his trouble, anxiety, and mystification to keep the secret, should he
  needlessly go to anybody's printing-office to correct the proofs, and
  thus wantonly risk the consequences?&mdash;in fact, go there and betray
  himself, as we are expected to believe he did? The story is absurd, on
  the face of it. But what authority has <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span>
  for asserting that Junius corrected proofs at all? Strong presumptive
  evidence leads me to believe that he did not: in some instances he could
  not. In one instance he specially desired to have a proof; but it was, as
  we now know, for the purpose of forwarding it to Lord Chatham. Junius was
  also anxious to have proofs of the Dedication and Preface, but it is by
  no means certain that he had them; the evidence tends to show that they
  were, at Woodfall's request, and to remove from his own shoulders the
  threatened responsibility, read by Wilkes: and the collected edition was
  printed from Wheble's edition, so far as it went, and the remainder from
  slips cut from the <i>Public Advertiser</i>, both corrected by Junius;
  but we have no reason to believe that Junius ever saw a proof, even of
  the collected edition,&mdash;many reasons that tend strongly to the
  contrary opinion. Under these circumstances, we are required to believe
  an anonymous story, which runs counter to all evidence, that we may
  superadd an absurdity.</p>

  <p>Mr. Pickering further referred to Mr. Raphael West, as one who "could
  tell much on the subject." Here <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> enlarges
  on the original, and tells us what this "much" consisted of. The story,
  professedly told by Benjamin West, about Maclean and Junius, on which Sir
  David Brewster founded his theory, may be found in Galt's <i>Life of
  West</i>. But Galt himself, in his subsequent autobiography, admits that
  the story told by West "does not relate the actual circumstances of the
  case correctly;" that is to say, Galt had found out, in the interval,
  that it was open to contradiction and disproof, and it has since been
  disproved in the <i>Athenæum</i>. So much for a story discredited by the
  narrator himself. Of these facts <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> is
  entirely ignorant, and therefore proceeds by the following extraordinary
  circumstantialities to uphold it. "The late President of the Royal
  Academy knew Maclean; and his son, the late Raphael West, <i>told the
  writer of these remarks</i> [<span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> himself]
  that <i>when a young man</i> he had seen him [Maclean] in the evening at
  his father's house in Newman Street, and <i>once heard him repeat a
  passage in one of the letters which was not then published</i>;" and
  <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span> adds, "a more correct and veracious man
  than Mr. R. West could not be." So be it. Still it is strange that the
  President, who was said to have told his anecdote expressly to show that
  Maclean was Junius, never thought to confirm it by the conclusive proof
  of having read the letters before they were published! Further,&mdash;and
  we leave the question of extreme accuracy and <i>veraciousness</i> to be
  settled by <span class="sc">Ægrotus</span>,&mdash;the President West was
  born in 1738; he embarked from America for Italy in 1759; on his return
  he visited England in 1763, and such was the patronage with which he was
  welcomed, that his friends recommended him to take up his residence in
  London. This he was willing to do, provided a young American lady to whom
  he was attached would come to England. She consented; his father
  accompanied her, and they were married on the 2nd of September, 1765, at
  St. Martin's Church. Now Maclean embarked for India in December, 1773, or
  January, 1774, and was lost at sea, when "the young man," Master Raphael,
  could not have been more than seven years of age,&mdash;nay, to speak by
  the card, as Master Raphael heard one of Junius' letters read before it
  was published, and as the last was published in January, 1772, it
  follows, assuming that he was the eldest child, born in nine months to
  the hour, and that it was the very last letter that he heard read, he
  <i>may have been</i> five years and seven months old&mdash;a very "young
  man" indeed; or rather, all circumstances considered, as precocious a
  youth as he who found out the vellum-bound copy years before it was known
  to be in existence.</p>

  <p>I regret to have occupied so much of your space. But speculation on
  this subject is just now the fashion. "<span class="sc">Notes and
  Queries</span>" is likely hereafter to become an authority, and if these
  circumstantial statements are admitted into its columns, they must be as
  circumstantially disproved.</p>

  <p><i>The Ten Commandments</i> (Vol. iii., p. 166.).&mdash;The
  controversy on the division of the Ten Commandments between the Romanists
  and Lutherans on the one side, and the Reformers or Calvinists on the
  other, has been discussed in the following works&mdash;1. Goth
  (Cardinalis), <i>Vera Ecclesia, &amp;c.</i>, Venet., 1750 (Art. xvi. §
  7.); 2. Chamieri <i>Panstratia</i> (tom&nbsp;i. l.&nbsp;xxi. c.&nbsp;viii.); 3. Riveti

  Pace Ecclesiastica contra H. Grotii Votum</i>.); 4. Bohlii <i>Vera
  divisio Decalogi ex infallibili principio accentuationis</i>; 5.
  Hackspanii <i>Notæ Philologicæ in varia loca S. Scripturæ</i>; 6.
  Pfeifferi <i>Opera</i> (Cent.&nbsp;i. Loc. 96.); 7. Ussher's <i>Answer to a
  Jesuit's Challenge (of Images) and his Serm. at Westminster before the
  House of Commons, out of Deuteronomy, chap. iv. ver</i>. 15, 16., <i>and
  Romans, chap.&nbsp;i. ver.</i> 23.; 8. Stillingfleet's <i>Controversies with
  Godden, Author of "Catholics no Idolaters," and</i> <!-- Page 413
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page413"></a>{413}</span><i>with
  Gother, Author of "The Papist Misrepresented," &amp;c.</i></p>

  <p>The earliest notices of the division of the Decalogue, are those of
  Josephus, lib. iii. c.&nbsp;5. s.&nbsp;5.; Philo-Judæus <i>de Decem Oraculis</i>;
  and the Chaldaic Paraphrase of Jonathan. According to these, the third
  verse of Exod. xx. contains the first commandment; the fourth, fifth, and
  sixth, the second. The same distinction was adopted by the following
  early writers:&mdash;Origen (<i>Homil. viii. in Exod.</i>), Greg.
  Nazienzen (<i>Carmina Mosis Decalogus</i>), Irenæus (lib. iii. c.&nbsp;42.),
  Athanasius (<i>in Synopsi S. Scripturæ</i>), Ambrose (<i>in Ep. ad Ephes.
  c.&nbsp;vi.</i>).</p>

  <p>It was first abandoned by Augustine, who was instigated to introduce
  this innovation by the unwarranted representation of the doctrine of the
  Trinity by the First Tablet containing three commandments. The schoolmen
  followed his example, and accommodated the words of God to the
  legislative requirements of their new divinity, progressive development,
  which terminated in the Church of Rome, in compelling them to command
  what He strictly prohibits (See Ussher's <i>Answer</i>.)</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hath God himself any where declared this to be only an explication of
  the first commandment? Have the prophets or Christ and His apostles ever
  done it? How then can any man's conscience be safe in this matter? For it
  is not a trifling controversy whether it be a distinct commandment or an
  explication of the first; but the lawfulness or unlawfulness of the
  worship of images depends very much upon it, for if it be only an
  explication of the first, then, unless one takes images to be gods, their
  worship is lawful, and so the heathens were excused in it, who were not
  such idiots; but if it be a new and distinct precept, then the
  worshipping any image or similitude becomes a grievous sin, and exposes
  men to the wrath of God in that severe manner mentioned in the end of it.
  And it is a great confirmation that this is the true meaning of it,
  because all the primitive writers<a name="footnotetag20"
  href="#footnote20"><sup>[20]</sup></a> of the Christian Church not only
  thought it a sin against this commandment, but insisted upon the force of
  it against those heathens who denied that they took their images for

  <p>With your permission I shall return to this subject, not of Images,
  but of the Second Commandment, in reply to <span class="sc">Mr.

  <p>Thus St. Augustine himself: "In the first commandment, any similitude
  of God in the figments of men is forbidden to be worshipped, not because
  God hath not an image, but because no image of Him ought to be
  worshipped, but that which is the same thing that He is, nor yet that for
  Him but with Him."&mdash;See what is further cited from Augustine by
  Ussher in his <i>Answer</i>.</p>

  <p><i>Mounds, Munts, Mount</i> (Vol. iii., p. 187.).&mdash;If R. W. B.
  will refer to Mr. Lower's paper on the "Iron Works of the County of
  Sussex" in the second volume of the <i>Sussex Archælogical
  Collections</i>, he will find that iron works were carried on in the
  parish of Maresfield in 1724, and probably much later. It is therefore
  probable that the lands which he mentions have derived their names from
  the pit-mounts round the mouths of the pits through which the iron ore
  was raised to the surface. In Staffordshire and Shropshire the term
  <i>munt</i> is used to denote fire-clay of an inferior kind, which makes
  a large part of every coal-pit mount in those counties. If the same kind
  of fire-clay was found in the iron mines of Sussex, it is not necessary
  to suggest the derivation of the word <i>munt</i>.</p>

  <p>I take this opportunity of suggesting to <span class="sc">Mr. Albert
  Way</span> that the utensil figured in page 179. of the above-mentioned
  work is not an ancient mustard-mill, but the upper part of an iron mould
  in which cannon-shot were cast. The iron tongs, of which a drawing is
  given in page 179., were probably useful for the purpose of drawing along
  a floor recently cast shot while they were too hot to be handled.</p>

  <p><i>San Graal</i> (Vol. iii., pp 224. 281.).&mdash;Roquefort's article
  of nine columns in his <i>Glos. de la L. Rom.</i>, is decisive of the
  word being derived from <i>Sancta Cratera;</i> of <i>Graal, Gréal</i>,
  always having meant a vessel or dish and of all the old romancers having
  understood the expression in the same meaning, namely, <i>Sancta Cratera,
  le Saint Graal, the Holy Cup or Vessel</i>, because, according to the
  legend, Christ used it at the Paschal Supper; and Joseph of Arimathea
  afterwards employed it to catch the blood flowing from his wounds. Many
  cities formerly claimed the honour of possessing this fabulous relic. Of
  course, as Price shows, it was an old Oriental magic-dish legend,
  imitated in the West.</p>

  <p><i>Epitaph on the Countess of Pembroke</i> (Vol. iii., pp 262.
  307.).&mdash;It has been asserted that the second part of this epitaph
  was written by Lady Pembroke's son; among whose poems, which were
  published in 1660, the whole piece was included. (Park's <i>Walpole</i>,
  ii. 203. <i>note</i>; Gifford's <i>Ben Jonson</i>, viii. 337.) But it is
  notorious, that no confidence whatever can be placed in that volume (see
  this shown in detail in Mr. Hannah's edit. of Poems by Wotton and
  Raleigh, pp. 61. 63.); nor have we any right to distribute the two parts
  between different authors. There are at least <i>four</i> <!-- Page 414
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page414"></a>{414}</span>old copies of
  the whole; two in MSS. which are referred to by Mr. Hannah; the one in
  Pembroke's <i>Poems</i>; and the one in that Lansdowne MS., where it is
  ascribed to William Browne. Brydges assigned it to Browne, when he
  published his <i>Original Poems</i> from that MS. at the Lee Priory Press
  in 1815, p. 5. Upon the whole, there seems to be more direct evidence for
  Browne than any other person.</p>

<h3>NOTES ON BOOKS, SALES, CATALOGUES, ETC.</h3>

  <p><i>A History of the Articles of Religion: to which is added a Series
  of Documents from</i> <span class="scac">A.D.</span> <i>1536 to</i> <span
  class="scac">A.D.</span> <i>1615; together with Illustrations from
  Contemporary Sources</i>, by Charles Hardwick, M.A., is the title of an
  octavo volume, in which the author seeks to supply a want long felt,
  especially by students for Holy Orders; namely, a work which should show
  not the <i>doctrine</i> but the <i>history</i> of the Articles. For, as
  he well observes, while many have enriched our literature by expositions
  of the <i>doctrine</i> of the Articles, "no regular attempt has been made
  to illustrate the framing of the Formulary itself, either by viewing it
  in connection with the kindred publications of an earlier and a later
  date, or still more in its relation to the period out of which it
  originally grew." This attempt Mr. Hardwick has now made very
  successfully; and it is because his book is historical and not polemical,
  that we feel called upon to notice it, and to bear our testimony to its
  interest, and its value to that "large class of readers who, anxious to
  be accurately informed upon the subject, are precluded from consulting
  the voluminous collectors, such as Strype, Le Plat, or Wilkins." Such
  readers will find Mr. Hardwick's volume a most valuable handbook.</p>

  <p>A practical illustration that "union is strength," is shown by a
  volume which has just reached us, entitled, <i>Reports and Papers read at
  the Meetings of the Architectural Societies of the Archdeaconry of
  Northampton, the Counties of York and Lincoln, and of the Architectural
  and Archæological Societies of Bedfordshire and St. Alban's during the
  Year </i><span class="scac">MDCCCL</span>. <i>Presented gratuitously to
  the Members.</i> Had each of these Societies, instead of joining with its
  fellows, put forth a separate Report, the probability is, it would not
  only have involved such Society in an expense far beyond what it would be
  justified in incurring, but the Report itself would not have excited half
  the interest which will now be created by a comparison of its papers with
  those of its associate Societies; while, with the reduced expense, the
  benefit of a larger circulation is secured. The volume is one highly
  creditable to the Societies, and to the authors of the various
  communications which are to be found in it.</p>

  <p>Messrs. Puttick and Simpson (191. Piccadilly) will be engaged on
  Monday and two following days in the Sale of a Library rich in works on

  curious collection." The mere enumeration of the various subjects on the
  title-page of the Catalogue, ranging, as they do, from Mesmerism and
  Magic, to Celestial Influences, Phrenology, Physiognomy, &amp;c., might
  serve for the Table of Contents to a History of Human Weakness.</p>

  Book worthy of being purchased by every Visitor to the Exhibition as an

  <p>ILLUSTRATIONS AND ENQUIRIES RELATING TO MESMERISM. Part I. By the

  Librarian to the late Archbishop of Canterbury, and Keeper of the MSS. at
  Lambeth.</p>

  <p>"One of the most valuable and interesting pamphlets we ever
  read."&mdash;<i>Morning Herald</i>.</p>

  <p>"This publication, which promises to be the commencement of a larger
  work, will well repay serious perusal."&mdash;<i>Ir. Eccl. Journ.</i></p>

  <p>"A small pamphlet in which he throws a startling light on the
  practices of modern Mesmerism."&mdash;<i>Nottingham Journal</i>.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Maitland, we consider, has here brought Mesmerism to the
  'touchstone of truth,' to the test of the standard of right or wrong. We
  thank him for this first instalment of his inquiry, and hope that he will
  not long delay the remaining portions."&mdash;<i>London Medical
  Gazette</i>.</p>

  <p>"The Enquiries are extremely curious, we should indeed say important.
  That relating to the Witch of Endor is one of the most successful we ever
  read. We cannot enter into particulars in this brief notice; but we would
  strongly recommend the pamphlet even to those who care nothing about
  Mesmerism, or <i>angry</i> (for it has come to this at last) with the
  subject."&mdash;<i>Dublin Evening Post</i>.</p>

  <p>"We recommend its general perusal as being really an endeavour, by one
  whose position gives him the best facilities, to ascertain the genuine
  character of Mesmerism, which is so much disputed."&mdash;<i>Woolmer's
  Exeter Gazette</i>.</p>

  <p>"Dr. Maitland has bestowed a vast deal of attention of the subject for
  many years past, and the present pamphlet is in part the result of his
  thoughts and inquiries. There is a good deal in it which we should have
  been glad to quote ... but we content ourselves with referring our
  readers to the pamphlet itself."&mdash;<i>Brit. Mag.</i></p>
